Fix The USB Drive Wrong Size Issue With Cmd Prompt

cmd
diskpart
list disk
select disk 1 (Careful! Choose the correct number here. See note above.)
list partition (Inspect the results to double-check this is the right disk)
clean
list partition (There should be none)
create partition primary
list partition (There should be one)
format fs=fat32 quick
list partition (There should still be one)
exit

Disclimer: 
If you try to use these commands on your own computer, make sure to select the correct number for "select disk 1". Yours might be at a different number, and not 1, so you don't end up deleting wrong partitions.
